class_name CharacterData
## One data resource per character (the "database entry"). A single reusable NPC.tscn reads this
## to know who it is: which sprite sheet to animate, which portrait to show in dialogue, its name,
## faction palette, and default conversation. Create instances as .tres files in data/characters/
## and pick them in the Inspector — GDD §13 ("NPCs = base NPC scene + per-character data resource").
