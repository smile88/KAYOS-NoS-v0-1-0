extends Camera3D
class_name CameraRig3D
## Camera for the HD-2D 3D game. Three ways to look:
##
##  • ORBIT (default): an iso-ish third-person camera that swings 360° around the target. Right-drag
##    orbits (+tilts), Q/E orbit from the keyboard, wheel zooms. Movement is relative to this frame.
##  • FREE-LOOK (hold `free_look` in ORBIT): swing the camera around the target WITHOUT changing where
##    the character walks or faces — the movement frame is frozen while you look. Release and the
##    camera swings back behind the character.
##  • FIRST_PERSON (toggle `toggle_view`): Daggerfall-style. Camera sits at eye height, mouse looks
##    around freely, WASD moves in the look direction, the player's own billboard is hidden.
##
## Sits in group "camera_rig" so actors read forward_xz()/right_xz() for their movement/facing —
## those return the MOVEMENT frame (from move_yaw in orbit, from the camera in first person), never
## the free-look offset, so looking around never disturbs the controls.
