class_name Player3D
## 3D-model player for the Cold Open: a CharacterBody3D whose body is a CharacterModel3D (a low-poly
## hooded figure) that turns to face its movement direction. Movement is camera-relative — WASD pushes
## along the orbiting camera's ground axes — and the model simply rotates to its heading, so there is
## no billboard-facing-camera and no quantised diagonal walk. In first person the model is hidden
## (you're inside it).

@export var speed := 4.0
## How close (world m, on the ground plane) the player must be to examine an Interactable3D.
@export var interact_reach := 1.8
## Robe colour of the player figure. The Cold Open dresses Talindir in a cool grey-blue.
@export var robe_color := Color(0.36, 0.40, 0.52)
## Off = the Cold Open's flat-plane movement (Y never changes). On = a real terraced world: the body
## falls, stands on floors and walks up/down ramps (Starfall). Kept opt-in so the Cold Open is unchanged.
@export var gravity_enabled := false
@export var gravity := 26.0
## Upward launch speed for a jump (only when gravity_enabled). ~1.2 m hop at the default gravity.
@export var jump_velocity := 8.0
## Hold to move faster — handy for crossing a large zone. Uses the "run" action if present, else Shift.
@export var run_multiplier := 1.9

## --- feel (gravity path only; the Cold Open's flat movement ignores all of these) --------------------
## Ground movement eases in/out instead of snapping, so starting, stopping and changing direction read
## as weight rather than an on/off switch. m/s² toward the target speed / back to rest.
@export var acceleration := 60.0
@export var friction := 70.0
## In the air you keep most of your momentum — only gentle steering — so jumps arc instead of pivoting.
@export var air_acceleration := 16.0
## Grace window (s) after walking off an edge in which a jump still fires — forgiving, standard platformer feel.
@export var coyote_time := 0.10
## Press jump this many seconds before landing and it still fires the instant you touch down.
@export var jump_buffer_time := 0.10
## Below this world-Y the body is returned to the last solid ground it stood on — the star-lake "Mirror"
## is sky, not water, and will not hold you (the causeway is the crossing). -1000 = off (the Cold Open).
@export var fall_limit := -1000.0

## Emitted when the body drops past `fall_limit` and is returned to safe ground (for zone flavour text).
